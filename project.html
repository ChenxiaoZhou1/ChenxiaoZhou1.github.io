                    This is the project that I made for the final in CS. You start out with a tree and every second you gain 20 oxygen from the tree. You gain 50 oxygen every single click on the tree and each new tree costs 2000 oxygen to plant. You also get a small boost of oxygen every time you plant a tree to boost oxygen production and make the game a bit easier. It was made with unity and is my first unity 2d project that I made completely from scratch. All of the entities were drawn by me, all of the code was done by me and all commented.
