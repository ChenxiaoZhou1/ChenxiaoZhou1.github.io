                    The process of making Tree Clicker was an interesting one. I at first wanted to make a tower defense game similar to blooms but instead of balloons we fight fire with water to protect the trees. However, it corrupted and crashed and it was too difficult to implement more features into it. Thus, I decided to change it into a clicker game. I decided to do a clicker game since I created a spawning script for the tree already and I think it will be a lot easier to make a different code for the point system instead of the entire enemy system. In the end, it turned out just fine and I am very satisfied at the result.
