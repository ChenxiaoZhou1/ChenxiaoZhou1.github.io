                My future aspirations are to be an engineer and to chang the world for the better with technology that I invent and create using my knowledge. I want to share and incorporate my love for technology and robotics to create something actually useful, actually interesting, or something that is used to change the world for the better. I want to leave my mark on this world before I leave it and I want to do that through engineering.
